# Student Workflow Test - ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

This document outlines the complete student workflow for the ROS 2 Fundamentals module. It serves as both a testing guide to verify the module works as intended and a student tutorial for completing the module successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

1. **System Requirements Met**:
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or WSL2 on Windows)
   - 16GB+ RAM
   - Python 3.11+
   - Node.js 18.x+

2. **Software Dependencies Installed**:
   - ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
   - Docusaurus development environment
   - Git, pip, npm

3. **Course Repository Cloned**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[organization]/physical-ai-humanoid-course.git
   cd physical-ai-humanoid-course
   ```

## Step 1: Environment Setup

### 1.1 Run the Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
```

**Expected Outcome**: The script should complete without errors, installing all necessary dependencies.

### 1.2 Verify ROS 2 Installation
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```

**Expected Outcome**: Should show an empty list or system topics without errors.

### 1.3 Verify Docusaurus Installation
```bash
cd website
npm run start
```

**Expected Outcome**: The course website should start and be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Step 2: Learn ROS 2 Concepts

### 2.1 Study Core Concepts
Read through the following materials in order:

1. [ROS 2 Architecture Concepts](./concepts/ros2-architecture.mdx)
2. [Nodes, Topics, and Services Architecture](./architecture/nodes-topics-services.mdx)
3. [rclpy Implementation Examples](./implementation/rclpy-examples.mdx)

### 2.2 Verify Understanding
After reading each section, students should be able to:
- Explain the difference between nodes, topics, and services
- Describe the publisher-subscriber communication pattern
- Understand Quality of Service (QoS) settings
- Identify the basic structure of a ROS 2 node

## Step 3: Hands-On Practice

### 3.1 Run Basic Examples
```bash
# Navigate to examples directory
cd simulation-examples/python-scripts/ros2_examples

# Run the hello world example
python3 hello_world.py
```

In a separate terminal:
```bash
# Echo the topic to see messages
ros2 topic echo /hello_world std_msgs/msg/String
```

**Expected Outcome**: The publisher should continuously publish "Hello World" messages with a counter, and the echo command should display them.

### 3.2 Create Your First Node
Follow the exercises in [Basic ROS 2 Node Exercises](./exercises/basic-ros2-exercises.mdx) to create:

1. A simple publisher node
2. A subscriber node
3. A parameter-based publisher
4. A service server and client

**Expected Outcome**: All custom nodes should run without errors and demonstrate proper ROS 2 communication patterns.

### 3.3 Test Joint Control Example
```bash
# Navigate to joint control example
cd simulation-examples/ros2-workspaces/basic_nodes

# Run the joint control example
python3 joint_control_example.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: The node should start and begin executing different motion patterns as described in the code.

## Step 4: Work with URDF Models

### 4.1 Examine URDF Examples
Review the provided URDF models in `simulation-examples/ros2-workspaces/urdf_models/`:

1. `simple_humanoid.urdf` - Basic humanoid model
2. `mobile_base.urdf` - Mobile robot base
3. `simple_arm.urdf` - Simple robotic arm

### 4.2 Load URDF Model (Optional)
```bash
# Visualize the URDF model (requires xacro and rviz2)
ros2 run xacro xacro simulation-examples/ros2-workspaces/urdf_models/simple_humanoid.urdf
```

## Step 5: Complete Assessment

### 5.1 Take the Assessment
Complete all sections of the [ROS 2 Fundamentals Assessment](./assessment.mdx):

1. **Conceptual Questions**: Answer all questions about ROS 2 architecture
2. **Practical Implementation**: Create the required nodes
3. **Analysis and Debugging**: Solve the provided scenarios
4. **Advanced Concepts**: Implement the service example

### 5.2 Verify Your Solutions
Test each of your implementations:

```bash
# Test your publisher node
python3 your_publisher_node.py

# Test your subscriber node
python3 your_subscriber_node.py

# Test your parameter-based node
python3 your_parameter_node.py --ros-args -p message:="Test Message" -p frequency:=2.0

# Test your service
# Terminal 1: Run the service server
python3 your_service_server.py

# Terminal 2: Run the service client
python3 your_service_client.py
```

## Step 6: Integration and Documentation

### 6.1 Use Interactive Elements
Interact with the code examples in the [Integration page](./integration.mdx):

- Run the provided code snippets
- Experiment with different parameters
- Verify that the documentation examples work as described

### 6.2 Document Your Learning
Create a brief summary of:
- Key concepts learned
- Challenges encountered and how you solved them
- Questions that arose during the module

## Step 7: Self-Assessment

### 7.1 Knowledge Check
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- [ ] Create and run a basic ROS 2 publisher node
- [ ] Create and run a basic ROS 2 subscriber node
- [ ] Explain the difference between topics and services
- [ ] Use parameters in ROS 2 nodes
- [ ] Implement a simple service server and client
- [ ] Understand Quality of Service (QoS) concepts
- [ ] Work with basic URDF models

### 7.2 Practical Skills Check
You should be able to:

- [ ] Run multiple ROS 2 nodes simultaneously
- [ ] Use ROS 2 command-line tools (ros2 topic, ros2 service, etc.)
- [ ] Debug basic ROS 2 communication issues
- [ ] Create custom message and service definitions
- [ ] Use timers and proper node lifecycle management

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Nodes Not Communicating
**Symptoms**: Publisher and subscriber not connecting
**Solutions**:
1. Verify ROS 2 environment is sourced in all terminals
2. Check that nodes are using the same domain ID
3. Confirm topic names match exactly

### Issue 2: Import Errors
**Symptoms**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rclpy'"
**Solutions**:
1. Source ROS 2 environment: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
2. Verify ROS 2 installation
3. Check Python environment

### Issue 3: Permission Errors
**Symptoms**: Cannot execute Python files
**Solutions**:
1. Make files executable: `chmod +x filename.py`
2. Check file permissions

## Next Steps

After successfully completing this module, students should be ready to proceed to:

1. **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Learning about simulation environments
2. **Module 3: AI-Brain** - Implementing perception and navigation
3. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action** - Developing LLM-driven robot behavior

1. ✅ Run the hello world example and see messages
2. ✅ Create and run custom publisher/subscriber nodes
3. ✅ Implement a parameter-based node
4. ✅ Run the joint control example
