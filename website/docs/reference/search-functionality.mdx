# Search Functionality

## Overview

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course website includes a powerful global search functionality powered by Algolia. This search feature allows students to quickly find relevant content across all course modules, documentation pages, and examples.

## Features

### Global Search
- Search across all course content simultaneously
- Real-time search results as you type
- Contextual search that understands the course structure
- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance

### Search Capabilities
- **Full-text search**: Find content by keywords in titles, headings, and body text
- **Faceted search**: Filter results by module, topic, or content type
- **Synonym recognition**: Find relevant content even with different terminology
- **Popularity ranking**: Results prioritized by relevance and usage

## How to Use

### Accessing Search
The search functionality is available in two ways:
1. **Navigation Bar**: Click the "Search" link in the top navigation bar
2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl + K` (or `Cmd + K` on Mac) from any page

### Search Tips
- Use specific keywords for better results
- Try different phrasings if initial search doesn't yield results
- Use quotes for exact phrase matching: `"ROS 2 fundamentals"`
- Combine terms with AND/OR operators for complex searches

### Search Results
Results are displayed with:
- **Relevance ranking**: Most relevant results appear first
- **Context snippets**: Showing where your search term appears
- **Module indicators**: Showing which course module the result belongs to
- **Quick navigation**: Direct links to the relevant content sections

## Search Configuration

The search functionality is configured through the Docusaurus configuration to index all course content including:

- Course modules and lessons
- Technical documentation
- Code examples and explanations
- Simulation guides and tutorials
- Capstone project materials
