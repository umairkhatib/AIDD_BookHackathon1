## Usability Testing Instruments

### System Usability Scale (SUS)
Administer the standard SUS questionnaire:
- "I think that I would like to use this system frequently"
- "I found the system unnecessarily complex"
- "I thought the system was easy to use"
- "I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system"
- "I found the various functions in this system were well integrated"
- "I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system"
- "I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly"
- "I found the system very awkward to use"
- "I felt very confident using the system"
- "I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system"

### Custom Course Evaluation
