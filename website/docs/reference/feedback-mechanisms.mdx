# Feedback Mechanisms

## Overview

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course includes comprehensive feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the learning experience. These mechanisms allow students, instructors, and other stakeholders to provide input on course content, functionality, and overall user experience.

## Feedback Channels

### 1. Page-Level Feedback
**Location**: Bottom of each documentation page
**Purpose**: Collect specific feedback on individual content pieces
**Features**:
- Was this page helpful? (Yes/No)
- What could be improved?
- Additional comments section
- Direct feedback to content maintainers

### 2. Module-Specific Feedback
**Location**: At the end of each module
**Purpose**: Evaluate module effectiveness and content quality
**Features**:
- Module difficulty rating
- Content relevance assessment
- Practical application feedback
- Suggested improvements

### 3. Interactive Component Feedback
**Location**: Within interactive demos and tools
**Purpose**: Gather feedback on hands-on learning experiences
**Features**:
- VLA demo feedback form
- Simulation experience rating
- Exercise difficulty assessment
- Bug reporting for interactive elements

## Technical Implementation

### Feedback Collection System
The feedback system is implemented using Docusaurus' built-in feedback mechanisms and custom components:

```jsx
// Example feedback component structure
function FeedbackComponent() {
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState({
    helpful: null,
    comments: '',
    rating: 0
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Submit feedback to collection system
    console.log('Feedback submitted:', feedback);
  };

  return (
    <div className="feedback-container">
      <h3>How was this page?</h3>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        {/* Feedback form elements */}
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```
