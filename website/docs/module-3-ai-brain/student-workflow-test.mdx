# Send navigation goals
ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose "{pose: {pose: {position: {x: 2.0, y: 2.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}, header: {frame_id: 'map'}}}"

# Monitor perception data
ros2 topic echo /perception/detections

# Check localization accuracy
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose
```

## Step 5: Isaac Tools Integration

### 5.1 Isaac Sim Scene Configuration
Work through the examples in [Isaac Tools Integration](./integration.mdx):

- Run the Isaac Sim setup examples
- Configure sensors in Isaac Sim
- Integrate with ROS 2 navigation
- Test perception pipeline integration

### 5.2 Isaac ROS Perception
Test the Isaac ROS perception pipeline:

```bash
# Launch Isaac ROS perception pipeline
ros2 launch isaac_ros_apriltag isaac_ros_apriltag.launch.py

# Or launch other Isaac ROS perception packages
ros2 launch isaac_ros_detectnet isaac_ros_detectnet.launch.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: Should see perception results being published to appropriate topics.

## Step 6: Integration and Documentation

### 6.1 Use Interactive Examples
Work through the examples in [Isaac Tools Integration](./integration.mdx):

- Run the provided code examples
- Experiment with different parameters
- Verify that the documentation examples work as described

### 6.2 Create Your Own Perception System
Based on the examples, create a simple perception system that:
- Subscribes to sensor data (camera, LIDAR)
- Performs basic object detection
- Publishes detection results
- Integrates with navigation system

Example perception node implementation:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
from vision_msgs.msg import Detection2DArray
from cv_bridge import CvBridge
import cv2
import numpy as np


class StudentPerceptionNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('student_perception_node')

        # Create CV bridge
        self.cv_bridge = CvBridge()

        # Publishers and subscribers
        self.image_sub = self.create_subscription(
            Image, '/camera/rgb/image_raw', self.image_callback, 10
        )
        self.detection_pub = self.create_publisher(
            Detection2DArray, '/student_detections', 10
        )

        self.get_logger().info('Student Perception Node initialized')

    def image_callback(self, msg):
        """Process image for object detection."""
        try:
            # Convert ROS Image to OpenCV image
            cv_image = self.cv_bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(msg, "bgr8")

            # Perform basic processing (for demonstration)
            # In a real implementation, you would use Isaac ROS detectnet
            gray = cv2.cvtColor(cv_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
            blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

            # For this example, just return the processed image
            # In practice, you would perform actual object detection

        except Exception as e:
            self.get_logger().error(f'Error processing image: {e}')
```
