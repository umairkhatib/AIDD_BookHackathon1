# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This course teaches students to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern AI and robotics stacks.

## Course Overview

This course covers four main modules:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the Robot Operating System 2 architecture and create your first ROS 2 node
2. **Digital Twin** - Master physics simulation and virtual environments using Gazebo
3. **AI-Brain** - Implement perception and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac tools
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Develop LLM-driven robot behavior

## Learning Path

We recommend following the modules in order as they build upon each other. Each module contains concepts, architecture explanations, implementation examples, and hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)

## Getting Started

Follow the setup instructions in the next section to prepare your development environment.
