## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md file for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course based on the spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, and research.md documents. The tasks are organized by user story priority and follow the required checklist format with sequential task IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive tasks.md with 90 tasks organized across 8 phases for the robotics course
- 🧪 Tests: No tests generated as this was a task generation exercise
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md file with structured tasks for all user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of individual tasks from the generated list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks were organized by user story priority with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing tasks from the generated list
